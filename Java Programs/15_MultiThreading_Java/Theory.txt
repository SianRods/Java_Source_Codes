In order to Implement the Concept of threads just Extend the class Thread And now your class becomes a Thread 
 The Concept of thread is used when we want to execute certaain things parallely 
 In order to start the Execution of any thread we need to use the call the start method 
 using the object of the a method the moment we call the start method from the 
 main it automatically starts the execution of a run method which is defined within that class


 only on doing th =e above task the threading can be Acheived ,
 However if the task to be executed is too small for a given thread ;
 the moment time is given for your thread to be executed the whole part get executed and not 
 partial ;

 In order to avoid this we use the concept of sleep ;so that irrespective of size of the task
 we can acheive threading
