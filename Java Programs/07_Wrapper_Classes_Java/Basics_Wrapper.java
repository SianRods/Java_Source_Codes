/*
 * Sometimes Inorder to take benefits of the methods of a reference classes the primitive datatypes in Java are used as Refrence Data types for that different types of useful methods can be accessible directly 
 *  Ex).
 * all are classes hence , Starting letter capital letter 
 *   boolean --> Boolean 
 *   int --> Integer 
 *   float -- > Float 
 *   char --> Character 
 *   double --> Double
 * ex) using integer class to take input directly from the command prompt
 *  Unboxing --> The Automatic conversion of Primitive data type to Wrapper class  is called as unboxing which is made by Java Compiler 
 * 
 * Boxing --> The reversal of Unboxing is called as Boxing 
 *                  Wrapper Class --> Primitive Data Types 
 * 
 * Remark --> It is important to note that although there are benefits in sometimes using wrapper classes in place of primitve data types but it takes
 *  more time in order to process set of wrappers class objects as compared to corresponding primitive data types
