// Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and
//  showing only functionality to the user

// Abstraction can be acheived with the help of the abstract classes 
// Abstract are classes in java which contain min one abstract and non abstract methods 
//  and the abstract classes cannot be instantiated --> objects cannot be formed 

//  All the child classes inheriting the abstract classes must compulsorily 
// write an implementation of the mentioned abstract method in the abstract class --> We are basically overiding 
// --> this process is called as abstraction 

// There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java

// 1).Abstract class (0 to 100%)
// 2).Interface (100%)

// Abstract --. Keyword in java used for classes as well as for methods --> Adds Layer of Security
