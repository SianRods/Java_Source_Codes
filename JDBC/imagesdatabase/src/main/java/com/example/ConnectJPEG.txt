It becomes important to understand how actually images are stored in an RDBMS like MYSQL 
1. STORING === images(jpeg) --> binaryforms (array of bytes)--> are written to the database 
2. RETREIVING === images(binary format )--> read into array of bytes --> reconverted using  outputstream to File io manager
there are several exceptions which are to be necssarily handled here 
like FileNotFoundException ; IOException , etc ;

Database Table --> id AUTO_IINCREMENT PRIMARY KEY 
---> longlblob (datatype used for storing binary number in long format)
---> TIMESTAMP for recording when actually did the image was recorded in the database
